The current building blocks in the architecture consists of services to export and stream timeseries data and metadata from Equinor data sources to Omnia, and make them available in APIs that customers can use to build new value-adding applications and services. The platform also have services that internal and external customers can use to stream timeseries data back to the platform.

## Working mode
The team building the platform operates in two-week sprints, and a product goes through Alpha, Beta, General Available (GA) and Deprecation phases. When a product is released in Beta, invited customers and stakeholders will test and provide feedback on the product. 

A product or feature will be available and supported 12 months after customers have been notified that it will be removed. Deprecation takes for instance place when there is a new major release. The previous version can then be used and will be supported for 12 months before it is taken out of production.
